    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Preserved lemons are lemons (usually whole, split, or quartered) that have been packed in salt and brined in water or additional lemon juice—essentially, they’re pickled lemons. Especially common in Middle Eastern, North African, and South Asian cooking, they add a savory tang to everything from stews to braises, dressings, and sauces. Texture-wise, the lemons break down in the brining process—the rind and pith soften, becoming squeaky, edible, and ready to fall apart with just a little heat or pressure.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
<li>8 to 10 lemons (Meyer if you have them but Eureka—the regular grocery store type—are fine)</li>
<li>1/2 to 1 cup kosher salt</li>
<li>Extra fresh squeezed lemon juice, if needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 2 tablespoons of kosher salt at the bottom of a sterilized 1-quart wide-mouthed canning jar.</li>
        <li>Rinse and scrub clean the lemons. With each lemon, cut off any stems. Cut off 1/4 inch from the tip of the lemons. Cut the lemons lengthwise in half, but keep the lemon attached at the base, do not cut all the way through. Then make another cut the same way, as if you were cutting the lemons into quarters, but not all the way through.</li>
        <li>Gently pull open the lemons and sprinkle well with kosher salt, inside and out.</li>
        <li>Put the prepared lemons to the jar, one at a time. After each one, press it down so its juices come out and rise to the top. Pack the jar with lemons, making sure that they are covered with juice.</li>
        <li>Add more juice if needed to submerge the lemons (you may need up to an additional 1/2 cup) and add a couple more tablespoons of kosher salt to the top.</li>
        <li>Close the lid to the jar and let it sit at room temperature on the counter for a few days. Turn the jar upside down every so often. After a few days put the jar of lemons in the refrigerator for at least 3 weeks, until the rinds of the lemons soften. Turn the jar upside down occasionally while storing in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>To use preserved lemons in cooking, remove one from the jar and rinse it to remove the salt. Discard any seeds. Remove the pulp. Thinly slice or chop the preserved lemon rind to use in a recipe.</li>
    </ol>
